    Trigun (Japanese: トライガン, Hepburn: Toraigan) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhiro
    Nightow. It was first serialized in Tokuma Shoten's shōnen manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Captain from March 1995 to
    December 1996, until the magazine ceased its publication; its chapters were collected in three tankōbon volumes. The
    series continued its publication in Shōnen Gahosha's seinen manga magazine Young King OURs, under the title Trigun
    Maximum, from October 1997 to March 2007. Shōnen Gahosha republished the Trigun chapters in two volumes, and
    collected the Trigun Maximum chapters in 14 volumes.

    Set on the fictional planet known as No Man's Land, the plot follows Vash the Stampede, a famous gunman who is
    constantly fighting bounty hunters seeking to obtain the immense bounty on his head. As the narrative progresses,
    Vash's past is explored. Trigun originated from Nightow's fascination with Western movies. Nightow wanted Vash to be
    different from cowboys in Western movies by avoiding killing enemies and instead exploring the characters involved
    in each story arc.

    Trigun was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series by Madhouse; it aired on TV Tokyo from April to
    September 1998. An anime feature film, Trigun: Badlands Rumble, premiered in Japan in April 2010. A second anime
    television series adaptation produced by Orange, titled Trigun Stampede, premiered in January 2023. In North
    America, both manga series have been licensed by Dark Horse Comics. The anime series was first licensed by Geneon
    Entertainment and started broadcast in the United States, as part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block,
    in 2003; the series was later licensed by Funimation.

    In 2009, Trigun Maximum won the Best Comic category at the 40th Seiun Awards. Critical response to the manga has
    been generally positive based on Vash and his friends' actions and relationships, as well as the handling of action
    scenes. However, critics disliked Vash's predicament in regards to his pacifism and the plot being hard to
    understand. The anime series was similarly positively received.
